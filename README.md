### To-do List Android App Demo
This app was created for an Android workshop I hosted.

Running this app:

1.	Download the zip file through the link somewhere on the right of this webpage.
2.	Extract it.
3.	Open Android Studio.
4.	If a project opens up, go to file then "Close project."
5.	Select "Open an existing Android Studio Project."
6.	Choose the extracted folder.

Afterwards, you should be able to run it on an emulator or your phone.
